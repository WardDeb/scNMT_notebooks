# Overview

The jupyter notebooks contain all the code required to reproduce the results. 
The required input data can be found via zenodo and consists of two tarballs that should be unpacked relative to the notebooks.

  - mudata.tar.gz  
  - external_data.tar.gz. 
 
 The notebooks are supposed to be ran in order, though this is not strictly necessary (with the exception for 3_gastr and 5_scATAC_scNMT.ipynb).
 Note that there are two different environment files (that should be set up using conda) conf/linkapy_env.yml corresponds to notebooks 1-3, conf/integration_env.yml corresponds to notebooks 4 and 5.
